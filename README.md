## Setting Up The App

If you intend to follow the setup instructions, for this project it is required to have installed :

- **Wamp64** (or its mac/linux equivalent)
- **php 8.2.18** at least, installed on your machine and in wamp64
- **PostgreSQL 16.4** at least

***Note :** This project was made under **windows**. The following explanations on its installation are specificaly made for the **Windows OS** using Wamp64. If you want too init it using mac or linux, try to use xampp.*

### Initialise Postgres on Wamp64

You want to make sure Wamp works with PostgreSQL. You need to change the php and Apache settings to this end.  
Proceed as follow :

1. Go to the php file **for the version you are using**. From the root of the wamp64 folder, the path to it should look like that :   ```./bin/php/php8.2.18``` *(8.2.18 corresponds to the version of php you are using)*

2. Open the ```php.init``` file in a text editor 

<a id="liste3"></a>

3. Search for the following lines in the file : 
```
;extension=pdo_pgsql
;extension=pdo_sqlite
;extension=pgsql
```

<a id="liste4"></a>

4. Delete the semicolon at the begining of each line (';'). It allows your php version to use postgresql databases 

5. Navigate to the php.init file in the Appache folder. The path is like the following : ```./bin/apache/apache2.4.59/bin/php.init``` *(note that apache**2.4.59** matches whatever apache version you have installed with Wamp64)*

6. Repeat point [2](#liste2), [3](#liste3) and [4](#liste4) on this php.init file.

7. Launch or re-start Wamp.

To verify that the changes took place, open your browser and enter ```localhost``` in the search bar. The Wampserver page should appear, click **'phpinfo()'** under the 'Tools' category. On the page that opens, check if **'pgsql'** appears below 'Configuration'

### Initiate the project

Once you made sure Wamp64 was setup properly, you can go to the **./www** folder. Here, **create a new folder** called **'project_web'** in which you can copy the project repository. From the root of the wamp folder, the path to the project file should look like the following :

```
./www/project_web_folder
```

<a id="set-up-database"></a>

### Set up database

Now it is time to set up the database the site will use. Make sure you have installed **PostgreSQL** *at least* version **16.4**. (*To verify you can run the command **psql --version***)

To initialise the database, enter the following commande.

```bash
psql -U postgres -d challenge_web -f ./documents/tableCreation.sql
```

Next, you should open the file ```./backend/bdd/bdd.php``` and modify your port informations, user name and password at ligne 10 as follow :

```php
$bdd = new PDO("pgsql:host=localhost;port=[base port];dbname=challenge_web","[base username]","[base password]");
```
